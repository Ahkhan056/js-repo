// console.log(2==2);
// console.log(2<=2);
// console.log(2!=2);

//simple converstion in java and also this is best practice to use.


console.log("2">1); // output is ture coz the "2" is converted from string toNumber (2) and 2 > 1 so output =true 
console.log("02">1); // same case as above ...

console.log(null>0);
console.log(null==0);  // comparison >= and equality operators are different things in js .. as there is no type conversion in equality operator..
console.log(null>=0);

console.log(undefined>0);
console.log(undefined==0);  // comparison >= and equality operators are different things in js .. as there is no type conversion in equality operator..

console.log("2"===2); // strict equality operator.doen and check the type of the variable and also value of the variable.
